 Moin here from the Technical Support Team. Thank you for reaching out. I'll be assisting you in this conversation.

10:53 AM | Moin from Elegant Themes: I'm unable to Access the Admin Dashboard. Do you have Membership plugin activated?

11:18 AM | Oleksandr Berets: membership plugin give a link please and instruction

11:20 AM | Moin from Elegant Themes: I can not access the dashboard using Remote Access. I will need an admin login to investigate further. 👍 
 
 Please create a new admin account following the steps below: 
 
 1. Go to the Users page in your Dashboard 
2. Create a new username 
3. Set the role to be Administrator 
4. You can use a dummy email such as mail@mail.com (mailto:mail@mail.com) 
5. Copy the username and the password that WordPress generates and paste them here 
6. Once we have the login details - someone will log in and check this issue for you. 
 Disclaimer: Please ensure that a strong password is used when creating this temporary account and that you delete it after we are finished with the investigation. This is really important in order to ensure your website stays safe, as we can’t delete it ourselves after investigating the problem.

 I can also see that you created the page design in the Header. It should be in the Main Content area.

 I can see you used HTML code in the widget area. Please check the HTML code and see why is it not showing up.

12:13 PM | Oleksandr Berets: Thanks. Yesterday when i build it. All works fine. With correct html.
I have a question about columns. I will need to dynamically pass content and images. When users create publications or posts, they should be displayed on the main page. If I found a dynamic display function for texts in the columns, I haven't seen such a function for photos.

12:23 PM | Moin from Elegant Themes: Sorry, I did not understand your question. Can you please elaborate on it a bit more or share some details for better understanding?
